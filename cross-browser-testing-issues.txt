IE11 issues:
SVG/CSS animation did not function
  Researched this issue - I was unable to find a solution other than comments that IE11 does not support animating SVG images with CSS
All grid cells except the last child collapse onto each other
  Spent several hours trying to resolve this but couldn't find a fix that worked.
